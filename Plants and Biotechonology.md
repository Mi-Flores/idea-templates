1. Initial Idea

 What concept, observation, or inspiration did I notice?

 I heard that Ganoderma is considered the “king of plants” and Spirulina the “queen” according to 
ancient Asian traditions. They were believed to be keys to longevity. I wondered if this could relate 
to immortality. I also saw a video of a monk generating natural electricity from his body by concentrating 
energy below the navel. I asked myself: could this act like a “charge switch” for the body? Could there be a 
connection with special medicinal plants, like Ganoderma and Spirulina, to facilitate energy flow in the body, similar to electricity in circuits?

2. What metaphor, image, or word came to mind?

 Battery, circuit, energy flow, key, switch, frequency, connection, current

3. Date and context

 Where were you, what were you doing, what triggered the idea?

I was watching videos and reading about longevity, traditional medicine, and energy practices. My mind started 
connecting these ideas while imagining the body as an electrical system.

4. Connections Map

Related concepts:


Ganoderma → longevity → bio-energy
Spirulina → longevity → nutrition
Monk’s electricity → energy control → human bioelectricity
Frequency / Hertz → body resonance → possible “charge protocol”

Central pattern (“new possibilities” / insight):


Conceptual framework: combining plant-based energy enhancement with bioelectric energy management in the body, 
possibly modulated by specific frequencies (Hertz), like a living circuit.

5. Analogies / Comparisons

Human systems:

Body as a circuit, blood flow and energy as electrical current, “charge switch” as focus/concentration point (below navel)

Plants as bio-energy boosters, nutrients enhancing the “circuit efficiency”


Technology / physical systems:

Resembles a battery or capacitor charging a device


Frequency (6.5 Hz) acts like a “signal code” to regulate flow

Circuit analogy: switch (monk concentration) + energy input (plants) + frequency tuning → sustainable energy management


6. Potential Insights / Ideas

Investigate correlations between bioactive compounds in Ganoderma and Spirulina and human energy metabolism


Explore meditation / breathing techniques as “switches” to regulate bioelectric energy


Consider controlled experiments or simulations with frequency resonance (6.5 Hz or multiples)


Keep a diary of observations to refine analogies and conceptual connections


Use this framework to generate new hypotheses about longevity, energy flow, and bioelectric regulation
