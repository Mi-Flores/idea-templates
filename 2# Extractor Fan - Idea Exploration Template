1. Initial Idea 
What did I observe?


2. What metaphor, image, or word came to mind?

Triggers, Levers, Springs, Connections, Electrical impulses, 180-degree rotation, Automatic manipulation, Data filter (data comes in and out).
3. Date and context (where were you, what were you doing?)

August 21st – I was in the kitchen and saw the extractor fan. It has five buttons: 1 off, 3 with numbers (1, 2, 3), and the last one with a light on.

Diagram / List of connections:

   Extractor Fan
         /       |       \		
     AI Systems  Automation  Human Workflow
        |            |           |
   Input/Output   Speed levels  Decision control

Central pattern (“new possibilities”):

Layered levels of control that filter or modulate input/output. The extractor resembles systems 
where different intensities or modes can be activated to regulate flow, just like how AI or 
organizations adjust based on context.

5. Analogies / Comparisons

Human systems: 

Like levels of authority or decision-making power in an organization (low, medium, high), plus a 
visibility/light mechanism that signals when the system is on.

Technology:

Comparable to neural network activation functions (different thresholds for activation). 
Also similar to data processing pipelines, where filters apply different intensities before output is released.

6. Potential Insights / Ideas

Everyday appliances embody multi-level control systems that can be metaphors for decision-making in both tech and organizations.
A simple interface (buttons + light) can control complex processes behind the scenes just like in AI systems.
Observing these mechanisms can inspire designs for transparent, easy-to-use controls in complex digital environments.
