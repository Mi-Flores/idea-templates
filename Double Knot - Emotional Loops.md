1. Initial Idea

 What negative thought or loop did I notice?

I always think that nothing turns out just like I want. It seems 
I can break or ruin something easily. As if I always would follow the wrong path on purpose.

2. What metaphor, image, or word came to mind?

 Storm, cage, spinning wheel, box, closed, hyperfocus, mental block

3. Date and context

 Where were you, what were you doing, and how did it make you feel?

 I was walking around the department thinking. I felt anxious, tense, and frustrated, with a strong urge to isolate myself.

4. Connections Map

Related emotions / triggers:


Anxiety, frustration, self-doubt
Triggered by tasks or expectations not going perfectly

Diagram / List of connections:


Thought: “I ruin things” → Feeling: frustration → Reaction: eat more / withdraw → Thought reinforces itself


External trigger: task goes wrong → Internal trigger: fear of repeating mistakes → Loop restarts


Central pattern (“core loop” to address):


Negative self-judgment → emotional tension → self-soothing via eating or isolation → reinforces negative self-judgment



5. Analogies / Comparisons

Human system:


Body responds with tension, increased heart rate, urge to eat, need to isolate, hyperfocus on negative thought


Technology / process analogy:


Loop acts like a “stuck program” in a computer; needs a reset command


Interrupts could be: changing environment, writing thoughts down, deep breathing, or structured distraction


6. Potential Insights / Ideas
Actions to break the loop / reinforce calm:


Step away and do 5-minute grounding exercise (focus on senses)


Write down the thought on paper and challenge it rationally


Move body: walk, stretch, or short exercise


Prepare a small healthy snack instead of impulsive eating


Talk to someone or share the thought to externalize it


Reflection / what can I learn from this thought?


Recognize that negative loops are patterns, not truths


Self-awareness allows intervention before the loop escalates


The thought is a signal to pause, not a command to act


Over time, practicing these steps can weaken the loop and reduce anxiety
