1. Initial Idea
   
What did I observe?

I observed an umbrella with flowers on top of it at a party. The flowers overlapped, one on top of the other.
Inside the umbrella, there are springs and connections that allow it to open and close automatically when manipulated.

3. What metaphor, image, or word came to mind?

Triggers, Levers, Springs, Connections, Electrical impulses, Security during data flow, Review, Verify and Validate 
identity of the users.

3. Date and context (where were you, what were you doing?)
On August 21st, I was attending a party. I noticed the umbrella while moving through the room and paused to look
closely at its design. I was in a reflective mood, thinking about patterns and how layered elements can interact, which
made me connect the visual observation with abstract ideas about systems and connections.

Central pattern (“new possibilities”):

The umbrella symbolizes layered protection and controlled access. Its internal springs and connections 
mirror how systems regulate flow — opening, closing, and verifying — much like how cybersecurity 
mechanisms verify and validate users before granting access.

5. Analogies / Comparisons
   
Human systems: 
An umbrella offers protection and organization against unpredictable elements, like rules and 
structures in organizations that shield individuals from chaos.

Technology:
- Comparable to multi-factor authentication systems, where multiple overlapping “layers”
  (like the flowers) add security. The internal springs and levers resemble mechanical triggers
  in security protocols that allow or deny entry based on validation.
  
6. Potential Insights / Ideas
   
Everyday objects like umbrellas embody hidden mechanisms of control and security.
Overlapping flowers can represent multi-layered safeguards in data systems.
The spring and lever mechanism highlights how invisible structures manage flow and access without 
being consciously noticed by users.

Observing such patterns could inspire better design of intuitive yet secure digital systems.
Internal Analysis of the Umbrella

The central spring


It is the component that stores and releases energy → it allows the umbrella to open or close with a single movement.


Technological analogy: like a trigger in a software system: it remains idle until it receives a command, and then unleashes the entire action.

Human systems analogy: like a critical decision in an organization; pressure builds up until a single moment detonates a major change.


The ribs (connections)


Multiple arms unfold in synchrony from a single central point.

Technological analogy: like a network connection tree (hub-and-spoke), where one central node distributes to many points.

Cybersecurity analogy: each rib can be seen as a protocol or verification layer that sustains the entire structure.


The canopy (fabric covering the umbrella)


It unites all the ribs and gives them meaning as a whole.

Technological analogy: the “user interface” or the visible layer of security → what truly protects the user from the external environment.

Human systems analogy: culture or shared norms, which tie together the internal mechanisms of an organization.

The opening and closing movement


It implies a binary transition: open = protection, closed = exposure.

Technological analogy: like a firewall that can be enabled or disabled.

Human analogy: like a personal or social boundary: you decide when to open up or close yourself off to others.
