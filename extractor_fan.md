1. Initial Idea 
What did I observe?

I observed the extractor fan in the kitchen. It has five buttons in total: one to switch it off, three numbered buttons (1, 2, and 3) that control
the speed levels, and a final button with a light indicator. The fan’s design highlights input/output choices and varying intensities of control.

3. What metaphor, image, or word came to mind?

Triggers, Levers, Springs, Connections, Electrical impulses, 180-degree rotation, 
Automatic manipulation, Data filter (data comes in and out).

3. Date and context (where were you, what were you doing?)

On August 21st, I was in the kitchen preparing food. While standing near the extractor fan, 
I became curious about its interface and how the buttons controlled airflow. Being in a reflective
mindset, I began to notice how this simple household device resembled decision-making systems, 
where each option changes the output dynamically.

   Extractor Fan

        |            |           |
   Input/Output   Speed levels  Decision control

Central pattern (“new possibilities”):

Layered levels of control that filter or modulate input/output. The extractor resembles systems 
where different intensities or modes can be activated to regulate flow, just like how AI or 
organizations adjust based on context.

5. Analogies / Comparisons

Human systems: 

Like levels of authority or decision-making power in an organization (low, medium, high), plus a 
visibility/light mechanism that signals when the system is on.

Technology:

Comparable to neural network activation functions (different thresholds for activation). 
Also similar to data processing pipelines, where filters apply different intensities before output is released.

6. Potential Insights / Ideas

Everyday appliances embody multi-level control systems that can be metaphors for decision-making in both tech and organizations.
A simple interface (buttons + light) can control complex processes behind the scenes just like in AI systems.
Observing these mechanisms can inspire designs for transparent, easy-to-use controls in complex digital environments.
